# Hello there!

My name is John Stuttler.
I have been building web sites since 2002 using vanilla PHP and MySQL. 
I am new to using Git, so you won't yet see much of my work, but it is coming!

## Repository Naming Scheme

To find repositories easier, each one will have a prefix as follows:
- php-  PHP Examples
- js-   JavaScript Examples
- css-  CSS Examples
- bat-  Windows Batch Files
- fork- Forked Repositories
